# Git-Simple-Steps

 Here's some very quick steps I gathered for setting up Git, getting up and running with your project from updating, creating branch, checking out branches, merging branches, and pushing branches to repository. 


- git clone - clone branch

- git pull origin - updates

- git checkout  -b - create new branch

- git add . - add files to stage

- git commit -m "" - commit files with messages

- git commit --all -m "message here" - Merge pain issues, merge all and commit all.

- git merge "name of dev branch" - merge new branch with dev

- git push origin "name of branch" - push changes to repo

- git push -f origin master - If you confirm that your new code is all fine. 
Where -f stands for "force commit" (or if on another branch, git push -f <repo name> master)

- git stash - save work

- git stash apply - add saved work to new branch if neeeded

- git reset --merge  If you've decided that whatever merge you were trying to do was a bad idea after all, you can put things back to normal 

- git fetch --all
- git reset --hard origin/master - git fetch downloads the latest from remote without trying to merge or rebase anything.
