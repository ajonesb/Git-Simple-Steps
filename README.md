# Git-Simple-Steps

 Here's some very quick steps I gathered to setting up with Git and getting up and running with your project from updating, creating branch, checking out branch, merging branches, and pushing branch to repository. 

* Always update before running your app
	- git pull


* git checkout master
 

* create a new branch named "feature_x" and switch to it using
	- git checkout -b feature_x


* Stage the file for commit to your local repository after development
	- git add .


* Commit the file that you've staged in your local repository.
	- git commit -m "Add existing file"


* To merge another branch into your active branch (e.g. master), use
	- git merge <branch>


* Push the changes in your local repository to GitHub or whichever repo you have setup. 
	- git push origin your-branch
	(Pushes the changes in your local repository up to the remote repository you specified as the origin)


* New Pull Request will be available (Will show exact url location of pull request on console.)
	Create Pull Request (Only for Bitbucket)


* Merge pull request once approved. (Only for Bitbucket)
